# c-exercises

A compilation of exercises written in C.

# introduction

This repository consists of basic training exercises written in C that demonstrate: a progression of syntax in C and overall programming ability within the language.

# main takeaways

This repository consists of exercises that:

* demonstrate basic programming ideas within a new language for me at the time;
* demonstrates the learning of basic syntax and properties within C.
* progression from beginner usage of C to more experienced and complex usage.

# conclusion

This repository is not meant to be much of a resume in the sense of "hey this is really complex code and demonstrates a deep understanding of C". Rather it is meant to show my ability and desire to learn new techniques and syntax within different languages in order to gain proficience. This repository goes hand in hand with my c-projects repository in that sense of showing my progression.
